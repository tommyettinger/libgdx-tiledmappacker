# libgdx-tiledmappacker
A standalone version of gdx-tools' TiledMapPacker.

See the Releases section for runnable JARs.

[See the libGDX wiki for more information](https://libgdx.com/wiki/graphics/2d/texture-compression).

This was taken from inside [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) and moved so it can be run more easily from
outside that framework. It still has the same license as libGDX.
